Blade-Runner
===========

Blade-Runner is a Python application that manages Mac systems through API calls to a JAMF server. It has the ability to manage, off-board, update, and delete JAMF records for a given computer. It can also auto-generate documents populated with data from the JAMF server, secure erase the computer, and notify Slack channels of Blade-Runner's progress.
